# NFL Fantasy Football Project Proposal

*By Mattison Hineline*

----- In Process.... -----

Overview of a machine learning project. Including project planning, data collection, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, machine learning - model building, testing, reporting, and reflection. 

## Overview

In this project, I aim to develop a fantasy football recommender system in which players will be suggested based on current and past player statistics, currently available players, and players already chosen. 

There are a handful of other applications that complete similar tasks, however, there are few to none that are as complete as suggesting, in real-time, who should be picked up, dropped, or traded. Additionally, most other applications require some prior knowledge of players such that the chooser must select a number of players (say 4 specific players) and the app will suggest which (of the 4) to pick. Although this can be helpful and insightful, I aim to create a totally new method which uses prior history of players, bye-week knowledge, current players, injuries, etc., to determine what a participant should do each week. This includes picking their first week players (building a team) all the way to suggesting players for each week based on who will be playing who. 

Not only will this project encompass the recommender system, it will explore other aspects of the data. I intend to use multiple machine learning techniques including linear regression, unsupervised clustering, and deep learning tactics. This app will not only contain information pertaining to the recommendations but also vital insights into players and/or teams as a whole. I aim to make the app interactive and easy-to-use. A final test will be conducted in the 2023 NFL football season where the recommendation system will be put to the test in a real Fantasy league championship. 

It may be valuable to briefly discuss the reasoning as to why this project was chosen, beyond my personal interest. Firstly, the NFl has been around for over a century and the concept of fantasy football began in 1962. In 1997, the online fantasy football app was launched, which, since then, statistics of player and team performance has been recorded. Further, the data is more easily accessible and standardized across platforms than many other types of data which makes data collection more reliable. Lastly, there will continue to be new data forthcoming in the foreseeable NFL seasons, which allows for model updates, testing, and user trials. Itâ€™s important to note that, in addition to the data stage of production, the project has many real-world applications and outside interest in the topic (discussed further in section 7).
